  On-Line Creation (OLC) is a set of utilities designed to allow builders to
  design their zones while on the MUD. OLC includes utilities for editing zones,
  rooms, objects, mobiles, triggers, and dialogues. The following commands are
  available to the online builder:
  
        edits                command                 listing command
        rooms                redit                   rlist <zone key>
        objects              oedit                   olist <zone key>
        mobiles              medit                   mlist <zone key>
        triggers             tedit                   tlist <zone key>
        dialogs              dedit                   dlist <zone key>
        socials              socedit                 socials
        zones                zedit                   zlist
  
  To create a new zone, a special command must be used. It's format is:
    zedit new <zone key> 
  
  All other OLC commands can set up new things (rooms, objects, mobiles, etc..)
  simply by using the corresponding edit command on a key that has not been used.
