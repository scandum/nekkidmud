  As a builder, you may at times create rooms, objects, mobiles, triggers,
  etc... that you do not want to be part of your zone. You can delete these
  things with the line of delete functions available. There should be one for
  each major type of editable zone content. When deleting rooms, anyone in the
  room will be removed from the game, and sockets will be disconnected.
  
  delete commands are: odelete, mdelete, rdelete, tdelete, and ddelete. Syntax
  is as follows: <delete command> <reference to delete>
