  Usage:
    alias                            list current aliases
    alias <command> <format>         assign a new alias to the given command
    alias <command>                  delete an existing alias
  
  Aliases are used to restring one command into another command. Aliases can
  take arguments, and they can also reference other aliases. If you would like
  to make an alias take arguments, you must use $1, $2, ... $9 in the alias
  format, where the number specifies which word in a list of arguments the
  argument will expand to.
  
  Example:
    > alias dyslexia say $2 $1
    Alias set.
  
    > dyslexia hello, world!
    You say, 'world! hello,'
  
  In addition to the $1, $2, ... $9 arguments, there is also a catch-all $*
  argument which means "all of the arguments together".
  
  Example:
    > alias chat chat --> $* <--
    Alias set.
  
    > chat hello, world!
    You chat, '--> hello, world! <--'
  
  Notice that in the above example, even though the alias called itself, the
  normal 'chat' command still executed? This is because when an alias is
  executed, it tells the mud it does not need to expand aliases any more. If
  you would like to embed an alias within another alias, you have to put square
  brackets around it. Like normal aliases, these embedded aliases can also take
  arguments by putting them within the square brackets as well.
  
  Example:
    > alias greeting hello
    Alias set.
  
    > alias greet [chat [greeting], $*! How are you?]
    Alias set.
  
    > greet world
    You chat, '--> hello, world! How are you? <--'
  
  You can also set up aliases to perform multiple commands. Each command must
  be separated by a semicolon.
  
  Example:
    > alias multigreet [chat [greeting], $*!]; [chat How are you?]
    Alias set.
  
    > multigreet world
    You chat, '--> hello, world! <--'
  
    >
    You chat, '--> How are you? <--'
